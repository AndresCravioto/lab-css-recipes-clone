    <p>This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one <br>
    quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place <br>
    prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!

      <h2><b>Directions</b></h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in <br>
        flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce <br>
        temperature and let simmer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a <br>
        lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so <br>
        that it does not run off.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 <br>
        degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.
